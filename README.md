## Welcome to this site I just created

This is my first time trying to publish R markdown documents to GitHub, following [this really handy guide] (https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/github-and-rstudio/). The guide was fairly comprehensive apart from 

* creating a `.yml` file. To do this in RStudio just open a New Text File, not R file or Rmd file and save as .yml)
* writing the `_site.yml` file. This needs to be formatted right & the text the guide provided was not formatted/displayed right. [Look here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-13.html)

This is for a beginner's guide to using R on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, because I've just tried to do that for the last three weeks and found that I had to consult many different websites and fora to find out how to do what I wanted. This document is meant for people who have never tried using command line, and may be a bit daunted about where/how to start. While some of the specifics are written for the University of Sheffield's HPC clusters (e.g. data storage areas), the guide is largely useful for those using other clusters which use Sun Grid Engine job schedulers.
